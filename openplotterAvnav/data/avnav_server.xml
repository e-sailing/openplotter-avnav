<!-- some basic configuration
     debugToLog controls whether any debug output will also go to the logfile
     you can change the loglevel by an HTTP request to the navurl:
     http://somehost:8080/viewer/avnav_navi.php?request=debuglevel&level=DEBUG
     maxtimeback: maximal time in seconds that we allow the system clock to go back before we delete all data
     settimecmd: command to set the systemtime (must accept time in format like date - utc - and must be able to run as pi)
     systimediff: timediff in seconds between gps timestamp and system time that we allow before we set gps time
     settimeperiod: time in seconds befor we retry setting the systemtime

       this will be used for signalk to get all of our nmea0183. signalk will itself connect to canboat to get the nmea2000
       directly, inside signalk just configure a connector to this port and the canboat nmea200 connector
     we additional have 2 plugins:
       * signalk: will receive all data at vessels/self from signalk and store it at gps.signalk in our store
       * canboat: will receive pgns that are not translated to NMEA0183 - currently only 126992 to get the time
     for canboat to work you potentially need to modify /etc/default/n2kd and /boot/config.txt
